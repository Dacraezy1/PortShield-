# PortShield

PortShield is a lightweight, real-time port monitoring tool for Linux. It helps you keep an eye on open ports, alerts you to unexpected network activity, and can even take action to protect your system.

## Features

-   **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously watches for new or closed ports.
-   **Process Identification**: Shows which process is listening on each port.
-   **Whitelist**: Define a list of allowed ports to prevent unauthorized services.
-   **Automatic Actions**: Optionally kill processes that listen on non-whitelisted ports.
-   **Logging**: Keeps a record of all port-related events.
-   **IPv4/IPv6 Support**: Monitors both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
-   **Clean Output**: Uses rich for a clear and colorized terminal interface.
